Project1 - In or Out is a website application built from scratch designed to simplify an everyday problem. Utilizing integrated data from several server-side API requests. "In or Out" simplifies the decision making between creating meal alternatives or finding a great local eatery at a desired location. 

If user chooses "In", they are to input a product which will then spill out several recipe options. Each option will provide a recipe displaying the amount of time it takes to complete, dish rating, serving size, and a link displaying the step by step process to complete the meal. 

If the user chooses "Out", they will be able to input either specific food they are looking for or the desired location they wish to search. Once entered the display will provide several options depending on the original input. Each item listed will include the name of the location, average rating, address, phone number, and a link redirecting the user to customer reviews. 

Project1 - In or Out is hosted GitHub and is designed to be responsive.
