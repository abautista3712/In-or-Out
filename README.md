Project1 - In or Out is a website application built from scratch designed to simplify an everyday problem. Utilizing integrated data from several server-side API requests, "In or Out" simplifies the decision making between creating meal alternatives or finding a great local eatery at a desired location.

If "In" is chosen, the user can input a food item which will then provide several recipe options. Each result displays the amount of time it takes to complete, dish rating, serving size, and a link displaying the step by step process to complete the meal.

If "Out" is chosen, the user is prompted to input both a specific food and/or the desired location they wish to search. Once entered, the display will provide several options depending on the original input. Each item listed will include the name of the location, average rating, address, phone number, and a link redirecting the user to customer reviews. 

Project1 - In or Out is hosted GitHub and is designed to be responsive.
